Django Treeview

This package can be used to generate and update an hierarchical tree of elements from MySQL database content for Django.

A HTML page with some Javascript performs an AJAX request to obtain the list of elements of the tree from a MySQL database query.

The tree of elements is returned to the browser in JSON format.
